# Activity-Tracker
It tracks the software and url visited with time spent on them

It has an issue which is when a new software is started it gives a error or exception(help!),but the code will work after displaying the error.
It also has some problem with Mozilla Firefox but if you work with Chrome than it works great.

It prints out Dictionary of the App with the time spent on it.Same with the websites too.
